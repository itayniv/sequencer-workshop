# sequencer-workshop

A music sequencer in unity.

Three major components here that we will try to code today:


1. Metronome to count bpm for the sequencer --> BperM script
2. Sound manager to play multiple overlapping sounds --> soundManager script.
3. Raycasting from camera to detect clicks on sequencer --> player controller script.
4. Instantiating the sequencer pads on canvas and running the sequencers logic --> sequencer script.


Build! Play!
